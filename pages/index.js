      Gastroparesis is a condition in which your stomach cannot empty itself of food in a normal fashion. It can be caused by damage to the vagus nerve, which regulates the digestive system. A damaged vagus nerve prevents the muscles in the stomach and intestine from functioning, preventing food from moving through the digestive system properly. Often, the cause of gastroparesis is unknown.

        <p className="whatIsItParagraph">
        Your doctor will go over your symptoms and medical history with you. He or she will also give you a physical examination and may order certain blood tests, including blood sugar levels.
        < br />
        < br />
        Other tests that are used to diagnose gastroparesis include:
        < br />
        < br />
        <strong>4-hour solid gastric emptying study. </strong> This is a test to determine the time is takes a meal to move through a personâ€™s stomach. A technologist will take you to a room and give you a meal to eat that is tagged with a radioactive isotope. After you eat this meal, a one-minute image of your stomach will be taken. You will be allowed to leave the department, but you must return in 1, 2, and 4 hours.

        <strong>SmartPill. </strong> This is a capsule that contains a small electronic device. You swallow the capsule, and as it moves through your digestive tract, it sends information to a receiver you are wearing on how quickly food is traveling through the digestive tract.
